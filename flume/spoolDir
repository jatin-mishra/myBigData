A Spooling Directory Source watches a directory, from which it reads events.

#. donot support modification in files or same name of files in it.

The Spooling Directory Source is a good alternative to using an Exec Source with
tail -F.
Once a file is completely consumed by
the source and all its events successfully written to the source’s channel(s), the source
can either rename the file or delete the file, based on the configuration.


The Spooling Directory Source uses a tracker persisted to disk to track the location
within each file at which events were successfully written out to the channel, so that
the source can start reading data from that position if the agent or machine fails and
restarts.

For per‐
formance reasons, the source writes events in batches. The maximum size of each
batch is defined by the batchSize parameter.

there are files that get written to the same directory that may actually not
contain data, like metadata files. To avoid ingesting such files, which are known to
not contain valid data, an ignore pattern can be specified via the ignorePattern
parameter. This parameter takes a regex, and any files with filenames matching this
regex are ignored.


To delete the files immediately, set the value of the deletePolicy
parameter to immediate . If deletePolicy is set to never (the default), the file is
renamed once ingested with the suffix specified by the fileSuffix parameter
appended to the original name of the file. Any files that use this suffix for completed
files are ignored, so be careful to not use a file suffix that could be the suffix of new
files that get written to the directory.



When a file is processed and events are generated from the file, it is often beneficial
for processing systems to know which file the events came from (for example, show‐
ing the filename a stack trace belongs to in a search UI). The full path and the file‐
name can be included by setting the fileHeader parameter to true . The key to use in
the headers can be set using the fileHeaderKey parameter (this defaults to file ).

The default name
of the tracker directory is .flumespool.

the value of the trackerDir parameter is used as a relative path to the directory
that the source is watching.


ex:

<agentName>.sources = sourceName
<agentName>.channels = channelName

<agentName>.sources.sourceName.type = spooldir
<agentName>.sources.sourceName.channels = channelName

<agentName>.sources.sourceName.spoolDir = path/TO/spooldir
<agentName>.sources.sourceName.batchSize = 250

<agentName>.sources.sourceName.deletePolicy = immediate
<agentName>.sources.sourceName.fileHeader = true
<agentName>.sources.sourceName.fileHeaderKey = keyName
<agentName>.sources.sourceName.deserializer = apacheDesirializer

<agentName>.channels.channelName.type = memory

<agentName>.channels.channelName.transactionCapacity = 500
