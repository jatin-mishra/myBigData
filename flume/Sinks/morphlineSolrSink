Several commands can be chained together, with the
output of one command being the input of the next, to perform heavyweight trans‚Äê
formation of data. Such a chain of commands is referred to as a Morphline.

The
Morphline Solr Sink integrates the Morphline framework with Flume by providing a
sink that can transfer data from a Flume pipeline into such a morphline (chain of
commands).

The Morphline solr sink converts each flume event into a record by moving the event body to the attachment_body field of the record.
