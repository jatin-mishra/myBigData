Hadoop's org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem is generic class to access and manage HDFS files
and directories located in destributes environment. FileSystem read and stream by accessing 
blocks in sequence order. FileSystem first get blocks information from NameNode then open, 
read and close one by one. It opens first blocks once it complete then close and open next 
block. 


FileSystem uses FSDataOutputStream and FSdataInputStream to write and read the contents in 
stream . hadoop has various implementations of filesystem as described below:

DestributedFileSystem :  to access destribuited file system
LocalFileSystem : to access hdfs file in local system
FTPClient : to access HDFS file FTP client
WebHdfsFileSystem : to access hdfs file over the web

URI and PATH :

hadoops URI locate file location in hdfs. it uses hdfs://host:port/location to access 
fileSystem.

URI uri = URI.create("hdfs://host:port/path");


Host and post on above uri could be configured in conf/core-site.xml file as below
<property><name>fs.default.name</name><value>hdfs://localhost:9000</value></property>

Path path=new Path (uri); //It constitute URI
